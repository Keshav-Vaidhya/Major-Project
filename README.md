Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of financial markets, stock market forecasting is a difficult task. Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units or GRU are two deep learning models that have, nonetheless, demonstrated promising outcomes in the prediction of stock prices. This prompts study towards the best prediction model, one that yields the most precise predictions with the lowest error rate. Time series data used to represent stock prices is combined with neural network training to identify patterns and trends in the data. To increase the reliability of stock price predictions, this system mainly focuses on using a model that combines both LSTM and GRU layers to form a hybrid that shows better results and accuracy than a normal LSTM model. Four models have been created namely, a traditional LSTM model, a traditional GRU model, a LSTM-GRU hybrid model with 2 layers of LSTM and 2 layers of GRU, and another LSTM-GRU hybrid model with 3 layers of LSTM and 3 layers of GRU. Among all the models used in this paper, the 4 layer LSTM-GRU hybrid model shows the most accurate results and lowest normalized root mean squared error value in predicting the remaining 30% of stock prices which is the test set, using the initial 70% of the overall dataset as a training set. Hence this model is primarily used as a backend for the stock prediction web application.
